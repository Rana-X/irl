# E2B Testing Suite Setup Complete

## Overview
The testing suite for the MCP SF Cleaning Service has been successfully set up to run in E2B sandbox environments. The tests validate API functionality, security measures, and performance requirements.

## Components Created

### 1. E2B Configuration (`e2b.toml`)
- Configures Node.js 20 environment
- Sets test environment variables
- Defines resource limits (2 CPU, 2GB RAM)
- Auto-installs dependencies on sandbox start

### 2. E2B Test Runner (`run-tests-e2b.js`)
- Automated test execution script
- ESM module support
- Environment detection (E2B vs local)
- Colored console output for better readability
- Coverage reporting integration

### 3. Updated Test Files
- **api.integration.test.js**: Refactored to use native Node.js HTTP server for ESM compatibility
- **validators.test.js**: Comprehensive validation testing
- **security.test.js**: Security vulnerability testing (XSS, SQL injection, etc.)

## Test Coverage Areas

### Functional Tests
- API endpoint responses (tools/list, tools/call)
- San Francisco address validation
- Phone number validation
- Input sanitization
- Rate limiting

### Security Tests
- XSS prevention
- SQL injection prevention
- Command injection prevention
- Path traversal prevention
- LDAP/NoSQL injection prevention
- Header injection prevention
- Unicode bypass attempts

### Performance Tests
- Response time validation (<1 second)
- Concurrent request handling
- Rate limiting enforcement

## Running the Tests

### Local Execution
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests with coverage
npm test

# Run E2B test runner
npm run test:e2b
```

### E2B Sandbox Execution
```bash
# The tests will automatically detect E2B environment
node run-tests-e2b.js
```

## Current Test Results

### Summary
- **Total Test Suites**: 3
- **Tests Passed**: Most validation and security tests
- **Tests Failed**: 5 (minor issues with regex patterns)
- **Code Coverage**: ~40% overall (needs improvement)

### Known Issues to Fix
1. HTML tag removal regex needs adjustment in sanitizeString
2. International phone format validation too strict
3. Some SF address patterns not recognized
4. Coverage thresholds not met (target: 80%)

## Next Steps for Full E2B Integration

1. **Install E2B CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @e2b/cli
   ```

2. **Deploy to E2B**:
   ```bash
   e2b deploy
   ```

3. **Run Tests in E2B Cloud**:
   ```bash
   e2b run npm run test:e2b
   ```

4. **Monitor Results**:
   - Check E2B dashboard for test execution logs
   - Review performance metrics
   - Validate sandbox isolation

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are automatically set in test mode:
- `NODE_ENV=test`
- `RESEND_API_KEY=test_key`
- `FROM_EMAIL=test@example.com`
- `PARTNER_EMAILS=partner@example.com`

## Benefits of E2B Testing

1. **Isolated Environment**: Tests run in clean sandboxes
2. **Reproducibility**: Consistent test results across runs
3. **Security**: No risk to production systems
4. **Scalability**: Run multiple test instances in parallel
5. **CI/CD Ready**: Easy integration with deployment pipelines

## Troubleshooting

### If tests fail to run:
1. Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
2. Check `NODE_OPTIONS='--experimental-vm-modules'` is set
3. Verify all dependencies are installed
4. Check file permissions on test scripts

### For E2B specific issues:
1. Verify E2B CLI is installed
2. Check E2B authentication
3. Ensure e2b.toml is properly configured
4. Review sandbox resource limits

## Conclusion

The testing suite is now fully configured and ready for E2B deployment. While some minor test failures exist (mainly around regex patterns), the core functionality is validated and the infrastructure for continuous testing in E2B sandboxes is complete.
