Fill in these exact details:

- **Name**: `IRL`
- **URL**: `https://mcp-sf-cleaning-d6gm9wmi3-for-irl.vercel.app/api/mcp`

## Testing Your Connection

Once connected, you can test by asking Claude:

```
"Can you help me book a cleaning service for 123 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94105? 
My name is John Doe and phone is 415-555-1234"
```

Claude should respond using your IRL cleaning service!

## Important URLs

- **MCP Endpoint**: `https://mcp-sf-cleaning-d6gm9wmi3-for-irl.vercel.app/api/mcp`
- **Test Endpoint**: `https://mcp-sf-cleaning-d6gm9wmi3-for-irl.vercel.app/api/mcp` (POST with `{"method": "tools/list"}`)
- **Main Site**: `https://mcp-sf-cleaning-d6gm9wmi3-for-irl.vercel.app`

## Troubleshooting

### If connection fails:
1. Make sure you added `/api/mcp` to the end of the URL
2. Check that environment variables are set in Vercel:
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/for-irl/mcp-sf-cleaning/settings/environment-variables
   - Ensure these are set:
     - `RESEND_API_KEY`
     - `FROM_EMAIL`
     - `PARTNER_EMAILS`

### Test the API directly:
```bash
curl -X POST https://mcp-sf-cleaning-d6gm9wmi3-for-irl.vercel.app/api/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"method":"tools/list"}'
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "tools": [{
    "name": "request_cleaning",
    "description": "Request cleaning service for San Francisco addresses",
    ...
  }]
}
```

## Alternative: Use Production Domain

If you have a custom domain, you can use:
- `https://irl.com/api/mcp` (once domain is configured)

Your IRL MCP server is deployed and ready to connect to Claude Desktop! ðŸŽ‰
